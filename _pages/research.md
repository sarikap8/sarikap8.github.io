## Conversational Behavior Modeling
**Berkeley Speech Group** | ICML 2026 (Submitted)  
*with Prof. Gopala Anumanchipalli*

We introduce a framework for modeling human conversation as multi-level perception, reasoning over conversational behaviors via a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). The approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a transformer to forecast the next speech act and generate concise justifications for its decisions.

## Speech Biomarkers for Neurocognitive Disorders
**Berkeley Speech Group** | Interspeech 2026 (Under Review)  
*with Prof. Gopala Anumanchipalli*

Developing automated speech-based methods for detecting and classifying neurocognitive disorders from naturalistic speech samples. Details withheld for double-blind review.

## Sex Differences in Multimorbidity Burden
**Computational Precision Health (UC Berkeley & UCSF)** | JAMA (Submitted)  
*Advisors: Prof. Irene Y. Chen, Prof. Yulin Hswen*

Analyzing multimorbidity patterns across 344,038 adults from the NIH All of Us Research Program. Our work reveals that women experience consistently higher morbidity burden across the lifespan, with the largest disparities in midlife (ages 40–59). This research has implications for understanding health equity and developing targeted interventions.

## Menopause-Related Multimorbidity Trajectories
**Computational Precision Health (UC Berkeley & UCSF)**  
*Advisors: Prof. Irene Y. Chen, Prof. Yulin Hswen*

Characterizing multimorbidity accumulation patterns around menopause onset using EHR data from 203,247 adults. This work examines race-stratified trajectories to understand health disparities in midlife women.

### NLP for Legal Document Analysis
**Berkeley School of Law** | 2023–2024  
*Advisor: Prof. Tejas N. Narechania*

Built an interactive NLP platform for comparing Supreme Court majority and dissent opinion drafts using semantic similarity and token-level analysis. Presented at the UC Berkeley Data Science Discovery Symposium (2024).
