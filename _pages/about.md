I am an incoming **PhD student in Computer Science at Columbia University** (August 2026), joining the [Spoken Language Processing Group](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/speech/lab.cgi) advised by [Professor Julia Hirschberg](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/). My research will focus on clinical natural language processing and computational approaches to healthcare.

Currently, I am completing dual degrees at **UC Berkeley** — a B.A. in Computer Science from the College of Computing, Data Science & Society and a B.S. in Business Administration from the Haas School of Business (expected May 2026).

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **computational linguistics**, **clinical NLP**, and **health informatics**:

- Speech and language technologies for healthcare
- Neurocognitive disorder detection from naturalistic speech
- Large-scale electronic health record (EHR) analysis
- Human-centered and trustworthy clinical AI

## Current Research

I work with [Prof. Irene Chen](https://irenechen.net/) and [Prof. Yulin Hswen](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/yulin.hswen) at **Computational Precision Health** (UC Berkeley & UCSF), investigating sex differences in multimorbidity burden.

I also collaborate with [Prof. Gopala Anumanchipalli](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~gopala/) at the **Berkeley Speech Group**, developing automated systems for diagnosing Primary Progressive Aphasia from narrative speech.

## Coursework

**CS:** 61A, 61B, 61C, 70, 161, 162, 170, [180](https://sarikap8.github.io/cs180-portfolio/), 185, 188, 189, 195, 375 &#124; **EECS:** 106A, 127 &#124; **Data:** 8, 100

**Business:** UGBA 10, 100, 102A/B, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 135, 191L, 192B/T/ID/MC, 198 &#124; **Econ:** 1, 100A/B

**Misc:** Math 53, 54, BioE 25, LS 22, ESPM 50AC, NutSci 104, MCB W61, Music 31, PH 116

## Beyond Research

Outside the lab, I play **intramural soccer** at Cal, maintain a running list of Bay Area matcha spots (always looking for recommendations), and love getting lost in a good book. Originally from **San Diego** — always happy to chat about the best burrito spots.
