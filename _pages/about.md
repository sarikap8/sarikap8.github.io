I am a **PhD applicant** interested in clinical natural language processing and computational approaches to healthcare.

<!-- UNCOMMENT BELOW WHEN READY TO ANNOUNCE COLUMBIA:
I am an incoming **PhD student in Computer Science at Columbia University** (August 2026), joining the [Spoken Language Processing Group](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/speech/lab.cgi) advised by [Professor Julia Hirschberg](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/). My research will focus on clinical natural language processing and computational approaches to healthcare.
-->

Currently, I am completing dual degrees at **UC Berkeley** — a B.A. in Computer Science from the College of Computing, Data Science & Society and a B.S. in Business Administration from the Haas School of Business (expected May 2026).

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **computational linguistics**, **clinical NLP**, and **health informatics**:

- Speech and language technologies for healthcare
- Neurocognitive disorder detection from naturalistic speech
- Large-scale electronic health record (EHR) analysis
- Human-centered and trustworthy clinical AI

## Current Research

I work with [Prof. Irene Chen](https://irenechen.net/) and [Prof. Yulin Hswen](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/yulin.hswen) at **Computational Precision Health** (UC Berkeley & UCSF), investigating sex differences in multimorbidity burden.

I also collaborate with [Prof. Gopala Anumanchipalli](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~gopala/) at the **Berkeley Speech Group**, developing automated systems for diagnosing Primary Progressive Aphasia from narrative speech.

## Coursework

**Computer Science:** CS 61A/B/C (Structure & Interpretation, Data Structures, Computer Architecture), CS 70 (Discrete Math & Probability), CS 161 (Computer Security), CS 162 (Operating Systems), CS 170 (Algorithms), CS 180 (Computer Vision — [portfolio](https://sarikap8.github.io/cs180-portfolio/)), CS 185 (Deep Reinforcement Learning), CS 188 (Artificial Intelligence), CS 189 (Machine Learning), EECS 106A (Robotics), EECS 127 (Optimization)

**Data Science:** Data 8 (Foundations of Data Science), Data 100 (Principles & Techniques of Data Science)

**Business:** UGBA 10 (Principles of Business), UGBA 100 (Business Communication), UGBA 102A/B (Financial & Managerial Accounting), UGBA 103 (Finance), UGBA 104 (Business Analytics), UGBA 105 (Leading People), UGBA 106 (Marketing)

**Economics:** ECON 1 (Intro to Economics), ECON 100A/B (Micro & Macroeconomics)

## Beyond Research

Outside the lab, I play **intramural soccer** at Cal, maintain a running list of Bay Area matcha spots (always looking for recommendations), and love getting lost in a good book. Originally from **San Diego** — always happy to chat about the best burrito spots.
